## Use Case 1: View All Countries by Population 

## Goal in Context: 
- The statistician wants to analyze global population distribution by viewing all countries ranked by population size. 

## Scope: 
Population Information. 

## Level: 
- User goal 

## Preconditions:  
- The system has up-to-date population data for all countries. 

## Success Condition: 

-The statistician successfully views a complete list of countries sorted by population from largest to smallest. 

## Failed Condition: 
- The statistician is unable to retrieve the list due to system errors, data unavailability, or network issues. 

## Primary Actor: 
Statistician. 

## Trigger: 
- The statistician navigates to the population data section and selects the option to view countries sorted by population. 

## Main Success Scenario: 
- The statistician navigates to the "Population by Country" section. 
- The system retrieves the population data for all countries. 
- The statistician selects to sort the countries by population from largest to smallest. 
- The system displays the sorted list to the statistician. 
- The statistician reviews the data for analysis. 

## Extensions: 
 ## Data Unavailable: 
- If the system cannot retrieve population data, it displays an error message indicating the issue and suggests the statistician try again later. 
 ## Sorting Error: 
- If an error occurs during sorting, the system displays a message indicating that the sorting operation failed and offers to display the data in its default order. 

## Sub-variations: 
- The statistician may request to filter the list by specific criteria (e.g., continent, region). 
- The statistician may choose to download the data in a specific format (e.g., CSV or Excel).
